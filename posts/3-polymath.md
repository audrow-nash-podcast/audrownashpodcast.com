In this episode, I spoke with Stefan Seltz-Axmacher and Ilia Baranov,
co-founders of Polymath Robotics, about their innovative approach to industrial
automation. Polymath is revolutionizing the robotics industry by providing a
modular autonomy stack for off-highway vehicles such as tractors, bulldozers,
and mining trucks. Their platform serves as an operating system for industrial
robots, enabling companies to implement automation without having to develop
core navigation and control systems from scratch. This approach has the
potential to significantly accelerate the adoption of robotics across various
industrial sectors.

## 3 Ideas from the Interview

1. Big, expensive vehicles are often easier to automate than smaller ones
   because they're designed to move slowly and cautiously, and the cost of
   sensors is relatively small compared to the vehicle's value.
2. Polymath is working on turning safety certification into a continuous
   integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) problem, potentially
   revolutionizing how robotics companies approach safety standards.
3. The most valuable machines to automate are often among the easiest, with some
   mining trucks generating a million dollars a year in recurring revenue for
   their autonomy providers.

## 2 Quotes that Stood Out

> "We're giving you that as a product so you can focus on integrating it into an
> actual product that's some farmer somewhere or some mine operator somewhere,
> or someone, whoever cares about. And you can focus on actually just making
> robots valuable as opposed to being the 1500th team to reinvent point-to-point
> navigation." - Stefan Seltz-Axmacher

> "We're building a foundation to have a web store. Like what Universal Robots
> did for arms - here's the arm, here's the foundation, and here's 50 different
> companies that will make apple picking or CNC machine tending with it." - Ilia
> Baranov

## 1 Opportunity

Use Polymath's platform to start a robotics company: Leverage Polymath's modular
autonomy stack to quickly develop and deploy autonomous solutions for specific
industrial use cases, without having to build the core navigation and control
systems from scratch. This could allow you to focus on solving unique industry
problems or creating specialized applications on top of a proven autonomy
foundation. For example, you could develop a solution for automating specialized
tasks in agriculture, mining, or construction, using Polymath's platform as the
base for your autonomous vehicle control.
