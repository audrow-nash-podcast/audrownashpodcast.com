In this episode, I chatted with Sanjay Aggarwal, Venture Partner at F-Prime
Capital, about the current state of robotics investments and the findings from
their latest State of Robotics report. We dove into the challenges and
opportunities in the robotics industry, discussed investment trends, and
explored what the future might hold for robotics companies.

## 3 Ideas from the Interview

1. There's been a significant shift in robotics investment from autonomous
   vehicles to "vertical robotics" - robots designed for specific industrial use
   cases.
2. The robotics industry is still in its early days, with only 25 exits above
   $250 million so far, indicating huge potential for growth.
3. The most successful robotics companies are focusing on pragmatic solutions
   with human-in-the-loop approaches, rather than trying to achieve 100%
   autonomy.

## 2 Quotes that Stood Out

> "We believe that the robotics industry is the next great frontier in terms of
> what's going to happen with our world. And it's going to be a physical
> makeover over the next couple of decades, hopefully sooner rather than
> later." - Sanjay Aggarwal

> "There have been 25 robotics exits greater than 250 million dollars [...] 25
> may seem like a lot, but it's actually a drop in the bucket in the world of
> venture capital. If you looked at enterprise software, the 25 might be a
> thousand, for example." - Sanjay Aggarwal

## 1 Opportunity

While many robotics companies are focusing on logistics and manufacturing,
there's a significant opportunity in the agriculture sector. Sanjay mentioned
that agriculture is still in its early days for robotics applications, with many
potential use cases yet to be explored. A motivated entrepreneur could start a
company focusing on innovative agricultural robotics solutions, such as
automated weeding, precision pesticide application, or novel crop transportation
systems. The key would be to deeply understand the agricultural domain and
develop pragmatic, reliable solutions that seamlessly integrate into existing
workflows.
