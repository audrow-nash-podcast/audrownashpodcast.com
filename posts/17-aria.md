In this episode, I talk with Jenny Read, Programme Director at ARIA (Advanced
Research and Invention Agency), about their ambitious new robotics research
initiative in the UK.

We discuss ARIA's £50M investment in robotics hardware research and their
mission to drive fundamental breakthroughs in robot hardware and actuation.
Jenny shares insights on how neuroscience can inspire better robot design and
ARIA's approach to building a research community focused on hardware innovation.

A key focus of our conversation is ARIA's unique funding approach that
encourages high-risk, high-reward projects, aiming to push the boundaries of
what's possible in robotics hardware development.
