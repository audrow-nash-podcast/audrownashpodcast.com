In this episode, I spoke with Oleg Kandrashou and Aleks Gampel, co-founders of
Cuby Technologies, about their innovative approach to making home construction
more efficient and affordable. Cuby is developing mobile micro factories that
can be deployed to construction sites, potentially revolutionizing the
homebuilding industry.

## 3 Ideas from the Interview

1. Cuby's mobile micro factories can be set up in just one month, compared to
   the typical seven months for traditional factories, allowing for rapid
   deployment and scaling.

2. The company uses Unreal Engine to create custom video instructions for each
   house build, making the assembly process more intuitive and efficient for
   workers.

3. Cuby's approach aims to significantly reduce labor costs in construction,
   which currently account for about 70% of building costs in the U.S., by using
   lean manufacturing principles and automation.

## 2 Quotes that Stood Out

> "We have a goal in maybe five or ten years to use humanoids just to do
> everything in our factories." - Oleg Kandrashou

> "We're essentially finding someone else to fund it and taking a licensed
> operating fee on it. But the groups that benefit locally from the system are
> home builders, and generally it's smaller home builders that need to find
> better solutions because they can't compete with the really big guy that's in
> their market." - Aleks Gampel

## 1 Opportunity

While Cuby is focused on housing construction, there's a potential opportunity
to apply their mobile micro factory concept to other industries. For example,
someone could develop a similar system for manufacturing furniture, electronics,
or even food production. This could revolutionize local manufacturing and supply
chains, potentially reducing transportation costs and environmental impact while
creating jobs in various communities.
