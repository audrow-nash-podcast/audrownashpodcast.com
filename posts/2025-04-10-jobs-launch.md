I'm excited to announce the launch of the Audrow Nash Podcast Jobs Board at
[jobs.audrownashpodcast.com](https://jobs.audrownashpodcast.com)!

Over the years of interviewing robotics startups and industry leaders, I've
consistently heard about a critical challenge: innovative companies struggling
to find qualified talent, and skilled professionals having difficulty
discovering the right opportunities. This jobs board aims to bridge that gap.

## What the Jobs Board Offers

For job seekers, the platform provides:

- Free browsing and application to robotics and AI positions
- Filtering by specific technologies (like ROS versions or simulators)
- Company stage filters from pre-seed to Series C+
- Email notifications for new positions from companies featured on the podcast

For employers, we offer:

- Free job postings reaching a highly targeted audience of robotics
  professionals
- Flexible application options (email or custom URL)
- A streamlined posting process that takes just minutes to complete

## Companies Already On Board

We've already welcomed exciting companies posting positions including Formic,
Luxonis, Rerun, and BotBuilt, with more joining regularly.

## Learn More

Whether you're building the next generation of robots or looking to join a team
that is, check out the jobs board today. I've also created a quick walkthrough
video showing exactly how to post a job on the platform.

As we face growing labor shortages in technical positions, particularly in
robotics and automation, I hope this platform will help connect the right talent
with the right opportunities to build our technological future together.
