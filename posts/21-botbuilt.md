Housing is expensive, and a big part of that cost is labor. What if robots could
build the frames for our homes, making construction faster, safer, and more
affordable?

I talk with Barrett Ames, Co-founder of BotBuilt, about how his company is
revolutionizing home construction by automating the framing process. Barrett
shares how they've solved the challenges of working with imperfect lumber,
translating floor plans into precise 3D models, and reducing on-site framing
time from weeks to just hours.

You'll like this interview if you're interested in robotics startups finding
that sweet spot between technical challenge and market opportunity, the future
of construction, or how automation might help address America's housing crisis.
