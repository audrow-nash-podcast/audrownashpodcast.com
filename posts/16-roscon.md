In this episode, I share several conversations from ROSCon 2024 in Denmark with
leaders building the future of robotics.

First, I talk with Marcus Scheunemann, Head of Autonomy at Dexory, about their
rapid growth in warehouse robotics. Dexory has scaled from 0 to 90+ robots in
just 2 years by focusing heavily on testing infrastructure and getting robots to
customers quickly.

Next, I speak with Christine Fraser, CEO and founder of Asimovo, about their
developer platform that makes it easier for robotics teams to collaborate. Built
on Kubernetes, their platform lets teams work together seamlessly whether
developing locally or in the cloud.

Finally, I chat with Angelo Corsaro, CEO and CTO of ZettaScale Technologies,
about Zenoh - the future middleware for ROS 2. We discuss how Zenoh solves key
limitations of DDS and enables true end-to-end communication from
microcontrollers to the cloud.
