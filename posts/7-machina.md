In this episode, I had an awesome conversation with Edward Mehr, co-founder and
CEO of Machina Labs. We dove into how they're reinventing metal bending with
robotics and AI, and got me super excited about the potential of these
technologies to greatly improve manufacturing.

## 3 Ideas from the Interview

1. Machina Labs is turning 4-year lead times for aircraft parts into just days,
   significantly improving fleet readiness for the military.
2. The future of manufacturing might not look like replicating 1940s factories,
   but rather creating new technologies that give a competitive advantage.
3. AI in manufacturing is evolving from simple regression models to complex
   multimodal systems that can interpret CAD designs and natural language
   instructions.

## 2 Quotes that Stood Out

> "We realized a while back that human form is not necessarily the most
> optimized form for all tasks. In manufacturing, we already know robotic arms
> are much better. They can be much more precise. They can have much more
> stiffness. They can apply higher loads." - Edward Mehr

> "I think the biggest lesson is hire well. And what that means is, it needs to
> be people who are passionate, mission driven, and excited for that technology.
> You don't want to just hire smart people." - Edward Mehr

## 1 Opportunity

Innovating new manufacturing technologies for reshoring: Edward emphasized the
need to create new manufacturing technologies that give a competitive advantage
rather than simply replicating old methods. There's an opportunity for companies
to develop advanced, robot-powered, and intelligent manufacturing processes that
are more suitable for the U.S. workforce and economy.
