In this episode, I spoke with Adrian Macneil, co-founder and CEO of Foxglove,
about their comprehensive data infrastructure solution for robotics. We
discussed Foxglove's journey from a visualization tool to a full-fledged
platform covering everything from data recording to cloud management and
visualization. Adrian shared insights on the unique challenges in robotics data
handling, the evolution of their product, and their recent shift from
open-source to a more sustainable business model.

## 3 Ideas from the Interview

1. Robotics data logging faces unique challenges compared to traditional web
   infrastructure, dealing with dense multimodal data and often unreliable
   internet connections.

2. The robotics industry lacks standardized tools for many common tasks,
   creating opportunities for startups to build solutions for deployment,
   configuration management, and simulation.

3. Foxglove's visualizer can render 2D images in 3D space and project 3D data
   onto 2D images, allowing for seamless integration of different data types.

## 2 Quotes that Stood Out

> "We see the whole data life cycle of, from your recording on the robot...
> because these are, things that are just, they work quite differently from a
> traditional Infrastructure space." - Adrian Macneil

> "When robotics has succeeded, we will see that, flip. We'll see that invert,
> right? Where a robotic startup will mostly be talking to customers, listening
> to their problem, figuring out how you're going to connect with those
> customers, how you're going to market to them, how you're going to sell to
> them, how you're going to support them." - Adrian Macneil

## 1 Opportunity

One exciting opportunity in the robotics space is developing comprehensive
simulation frameworks. As Adrian mentioned, there's a need for tools that allow
companies to run simulations at scale, manage simulation scenarios, and score
simulation outputs. A startup could create a platform that helps robotics
companies efficiently test and validate their systems across a wide range of
scenarios, accelerating development and improving safety.
