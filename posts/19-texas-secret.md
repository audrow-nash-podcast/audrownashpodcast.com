Ever wonder what happens when robotics experts gather in a secret location to
share their cutting-edge work? In this special episode, I bring you live
interviews from a stealth robotics event between Austin and San Antonio.

I talk with

- Kyle Morgenstein, PhD student at UT Austin working on making legged robots
  safe in human environments;
- David Venegas, Head of Operations at Durin, who's automating critical tasks in
  mining exploration; and
- Barrett Ames, co-founder of BotBuilt, whose robots are revolutionizing home
  construction.

You'll like this interview if you're interested in the future of robotics across
different industries, from research to startups, and how automation is solving
real-world problems in safety, mining, and construction.
