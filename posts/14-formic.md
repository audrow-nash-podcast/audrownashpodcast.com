In this episode, I spoke with Saman Farid, founder and CEO of Formic, about
transforming American manufacturing through accessible robotics. Formic is
tackling a crucial problem: most US factories run at just 30% utilization, while
facing severe labor shortages. Their solution? Making robots accessible through
a robots-as-a-service model that's already deployed in over 100 manufacturing
facilities.

## 3 Ideas from the Interview

1. Most American factories only run one shift per day, leaving expensive
   equipment idle 75% of the time - robots can run 24/7, dramatically improving
   utilization.
2. 90% of US factories don't have a single robot, mainly due to deployment
   complexity and costs, not technology limitations.
3. By automating deployment processes with AI, Formic has reduced installation
   time from 6 months to 2 weeks while cutting costs by 70%.

## 2 Quotes that Stood Out

> "For America to have a manufacturing base that sustains through the 21st
> century and is competitive, we are drastically under-tooled." - Saman Farid

> "About 70% of our customers never had robots before Formic." - Saman Farid

## 1 Opportunity

While Formic focuses on robot deployment and operation, there's a clear
opportunity for a company to develop specialized financing solutions for small
manufacturers adopting automation. Traditional lenders often struggle to assess
the risk and value of robotics investments, creating a gap for a fintech company
that understands both manufacturing and robotics to provide targeted financial
products.
