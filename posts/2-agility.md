In this episode, I talked with Melonee Wise, CTO of Agility Robotics, about the
future of humanoid robots and their potential impact on jobs. We discussed the
challenges and opportunities in developing humanoid robots for logistics and
manufacturing, as well as the realistic timeline for their widespread adoption.

## 3 Ideas from the Interview

1. Agility's Digit robot specializes in handling totes within warehouses,
   leveraging its humanoid design for agile movement in confined spaces and
   adaptive balance control.
2. The labor shortage in logistics and manufacturing has grown from 600,000
   unfilled jobs in 2014-2016 to over 1 million today, despite the increasing
   use of robots.
3. Melonee predicts that humanoid robots won't be part of our daily lives
   outside industrial settings for another 20-30 years, with the next 10 years
   focused on industrial and light industrial environments.

## 2 Quotes that Stood Out

> "One of the advantages of having a dynamically balancing system or a bipedal
> robot is you can have a relatively small footprint, you can reach relatively
> high, and you can carry a relatively competitive payload." - Melonee Wise

> "I think it's a great time to be a roboticist. This is the, probably the next
> 50 years are going to be like the heyday of robotics." - Melonee Wise

## 1 Opportunity

Usability and Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) Platform: Create a platform or
conference for companies to share and discuss their usability and HRI work in
robotics. As Melonee mentioned, there's a lack of venues for companies to
present their findings from real-world deployments with large datasets. This
platform could bridge the gap between academic research and industry
applications, fostering innovation in making robots more user-friendly and
effective in various environments.
