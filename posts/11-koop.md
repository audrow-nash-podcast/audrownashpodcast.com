In this episode, I spoke with Sergey Litvinenko, co-founder and CEO of Koop AI,
about how data-driven insurance is transforming the robotics industry. Koop AI,
backed by Hyundai, is using advanced data analysis to revolutionize risk
assessment for robotics companies, potentially making robots safer and more
affordable.

## Three Surprising Ideas

1. Robots are significantly safer than humans in many scenarios, with autonomous
   vehicles showing up to 70% reduction in risky maneuvers compared to human
   drivers.
2. The future of robotics insurance might involve real-time, usage-based
   pricing, similar to API calls.
3. Unlike human behavior, which is difficult to change, robot behavior can be
   continuously improved through software updates, leading to potentially
   exponential improvements in safety over time.

## Two Interesting Quotes

> "We believe that the robotics industry is the next great frontier in terms of
> what's going to happen with our world. And it's going to be a physical
> makeover over the next couple of decades, hopefully sooner rather than
> later." - Sergey Litvinenko

> "The beauty about robotics is exactly what you just said. If there is a bug,
> then we expect that this bug is going to be fixed, and this bug is never going
> to happen again. Very hard with humans, because it's very hard to change human
> behavior." - Sergey Litvinenko

## One Opportunity

A potential opportunity lies in creating a venture capital arm specifically
focused on robotics companies. With access to detailed performance and risk data
from insured robotics companies, such a venture arm could make highly informed
investment decisions. This data-driven approach to venture capital could provide
a significant competitive advantage in identifying and supporting promising
robotics startups across various stages of growth.
