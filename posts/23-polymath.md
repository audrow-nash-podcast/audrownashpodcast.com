What’s the real value of robotics today? Are we missing the biggest
opportunities by chasing hype?

I talk with Stefan Seltz-Axmacher, CEO of Polymath Robotics, and Ilia Baranov,
CTO of Polymath Robotics, about why the most impactful robotics work isn’t
always the flashiest—and how their modular autonomy stack is quietly
transforming industries like mining, agriculture, and logistics.

You’ll like this interview if you’re interested in how robotics is actually
solving labor shortages, why “boring” automation often creates the most value,
and what it takes to build a sustainable robotics business in a world obsessed
with viral demos.
