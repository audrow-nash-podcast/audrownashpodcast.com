In this episode, I spoke with Dave Coleman, Chief Product Officer and Founder of
PickNik Robotics, about how they're making robot arms work in challenging,
unstructured environments. PickNik has helped over 110 companies deploy robotic
arms in diverse applications, from picking strawberries in dynamic farm
environments to building lunar colonies with NASA.

## 3 Ideas from the Interview

1. Traditional industrial robotics solutions don't address the needs of modern
   applications like small businesses, restaurants, farms, and space
   exploration, creating an opportunity for new approaches to robot
   manipulation.

2. The robotics industry needs common platforms to avoid reinventing the wheel,
   similar to how game engines revolutionized video game development.

3. Advanced physics simulation with tools like Mujoco enables testing complex
   behaviors like force feedback and object deformation, significantly reducing
   the gap between simulation and real-world deployment.

## 2 Quotes that Stood Out

> "We basically wanna get robot arms into every part of our life. Small
> businesses, restaurants, your home. We want it to be outdoors and farm fields.
> We want it to be in hospitals, in space, building our next lunar colony."
> - Dave Coleman

> "Let's stop wasting all of this investor money on building the same thing over
> and over again."
> - Dave Coleman

## 1 Opportunity

While PickNik focuses on manipulation software, there's a clear opportunity for
a company to develop specialized simulation environments for robotic
applications in specific industries. For example, creating highly accurate
physics simulations for food handling or medical procedures could help robotics
companies validate their solutions before deployment, reducing development time
and costs.
